              A clear definition is "The ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of those around you". To expand on this, it's understanding your affect on other people and their effect on you and the others around.

              To put it simply, both are measures of Intelligence. EQ is your ability to recognise the emotions of yourself and other and to use this recognition to guide your decisions.
              <br>
              <br>
              IQ is the measure of your ability to solve problems, use logic, grasp and communicate complex ideas.

            <p class="values-body global-body fade-in-bottom-4">
              More than IQ, EQ will determine how to react in situations that arise in all areas of your life. One thing that's clear is that building relationships will take you further than just being techinically gifted. Being a good friend, partner, colleague, all takes high EQ.

              I did some work for a musician last year, doing a poster for an event of theirs. The client had a really strong idea of what they wanted visually. They provided thorough and consistent visual inspiration which is great and not something I often get from musicians! The tension came when they provided me the assets that they wanted to use on the poster, in this case a photo that their friend had taken of them. I tried to work with the image they had provided but it unfortunately wasn't taken with the design of a poster truly in mind, it was busy and over exposed, I couldn't make text stand out clearly and the spacing was wrong. I tried to explain these points to the client but I was more focused on being nice than being clear. The client asked to come over and work through it with me, there was a lot of tension as they didn't have the vocabulary to say what they wanted visually just as I wouldn't in music. We went through all of their ideas even if I knew that it wasn't going to work, eventually they agreed with me and let me design it as I saw fit. Everyone was happy in the end and the event sold out! Although this method worked it was painful and time consuming, this more than doubled the amount of time it took to complete the job. In retrospect if I was to go through this again I would have been much more confident in what I had to say and my reasoning. The reason being is that this experience made me realise times that I had overstepped during collaborative work without realising it. I think establishing a clear and respectful base of communication from the get go is one of the most important things you can do. Respect isn't always about being overly nice.
