              I've spent the last couple of years exploring my different skills
              to see what sticks the best, after monetizing a few of my passions
              (Photography & Graphic Design) I've started to lose them as
              passions, I'm hoping to work towards a Front-End Development job
              that allows me to use my creativity and problem-solving ability. I
              want to be able to travel around the world and still work
              intimately with people.

              When it comes to learning, my strengths lie in my speed. I find that it doesn't often take me long to grasp something when I'm locked in and when I am I can continue on that train. I genuinely love to learn and feel like I'm advancing. My limitations tend to come in my focus, I often get sidetracked or distracted easily. This generally occurs when I'm bored or uninspired. When I feel like something is dry.

              I think my human skills are my best skills, at least outside of work itself. I do however want to learn to be more respectfully assertive when it comes to collaborative work. I've found in the past that when I try to tip toe around what I'm really needing to say it comes off less concise and much more rude than it really would if I had just spoken up. Or when you see a flaw but for the sake of not offending anyone you don't say anything. I want to learn to be a part of a team that openly critques and takes critique when working together. I need to work on both aspects.

              I have been busy in a self motivated environment for more than two years now and I've never truly learned to manage my workload and be as productive as possible. Something I have come to realise is having a clear work/life split helps me to be effective and stops me feeling guilty for relaxing (Ironic as I write this on a Sunday evening). I need to block my time better and make a commitment to sticking to those time blocks, the amount of times I haven't stuck to the time boxes it's clear that I have plenty of work to do. But the amount of times that I have (Especially when learning something new) means that I am on my way.
              <br><br>
              When things are building up and starting to get to me I've always found that break helps. But not to go and look at my phone or just sit with my cat. I generally use this time to make a list and compartmentalise what I really need to do. The most effective thing for me over the years has been that when I'm stuck on something for too long I just need to move to something else, even if it isn't the most pressing thing that I need to do.

              Based on the information in the handbook I've outlayed a path of problem solving that begins with understanding the problem and ends with asking the faculty for help. I have steps to take. Having coded for a while now I've learned that almost any question or problem you have has been asked & answered somewhere on the web and this has become a quick fix in many instances. However I'm committed to leaving that as the second to last option through this period of learning.

              I simply expect support! The amount of hours is a huge undertaking and I have no doubt that there are going to be points where I need help. I don't just mean support in the form of help but also in the form of honesty about my work and approach to learning.

              Every two weeks I host a radio show on Radio Active. This runs from 04:30 - 07:00 each tuesday. This is my only true conflict. Currently I'm getting treatment for chronic back pain on the same day before the show but the timing on this is flexible.
