              I like to think of a house when I think of the relationship between HTML, CSS & JavaScript. HTML is the foundations of the house - the timber, the nails etc. CSS is the decorations - the paint, the art, the nic nacs. JavaScript is like the electricity. The house might be full with appliances and lights and whatever else but without JavaScript none of that can run.

              Control Flows are step-by-step processes. Decided the steps in which different actions happen. Think following a recipie for the first time. You follow the step by step processes in order to reach the desired outcome. Loops can be thought of similarly - a step or steps that are repeated until the desired condition is met. Like training an animal - in my case, my cat Creed. I give him the command to sit and show him a hand action - I do this repeatedly until the desired outcome is reached - him sitting. Then I give him a treat.

              The DOM or Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents, at least that's what mdn web docs says it is. The best way I've seen it put into layman's terms is to imagine that the tV is on and you want to change the show, or the volume, or maybe you need to adjust the picture settings. You need a bridge that allows you to interact with the TV, in this case, a remote. You make the TV active and dynamic via the remote. And in the same way, JavaScript makes the HTML page active and dynamic via the DOM.

              Accessing data from Arrays an Objects

              Arrays are ordered collections. This means that data can be accesssed by referring to the location of the data in an array. It's worth noting that index in an array starts at '0' so if you were wanting to target the third item in an array you would target array[2]. 
              <br>
              <br>
              When used correctly Objects represent a 'thing' in your code or a set of data pertaining to something such as a Person with a specified name, address, age, hair colour etc. Unlike an array you can't target for example the third item in an object, you instead need to target the correct 'key' to get the data you want. For example if a 'person' has 'age: 26' the 'person' represents the object, 'age' represents the key and '26' represents the data.

              Functions and why they're useful

              Functions are pieces of code that can be called on and executed. When this code is run it generally performs a task of varying complexity. There are many reasons that functions are useful but the main one (At least in my mind) is that putting a piece of code in a function allows you to re-use that code in other parts of your application without re-writing it. For example a function that that produces a result based on a user input. You can use arguments for the user data and produce the desired result based on those using one function.
