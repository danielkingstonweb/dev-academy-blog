              I found myself having trouble during Kata 5 trying to return a string with all of the words capitalized. When I realised I was stuck I re-read the problem (I've realised that I skim over things and ofen the reason I've done something wrong is because I haven't read it properly! My flatmate asked me to pick them up "Reduced cream and onion soup mix" today and I didn't think at all about them being obviously seperate things). Then I'd pseudo code to make sure I was attacking things in the right order. If I felt like my logic was correct I would check the documentation to make sure I understand the methods I'm calling and have the correct syntax. I learned that documentation is important and that often my logic is correct but my understanding of a method is not.

              I would say during Kata 5, on the deBee problem. Very similarly to the capitalize problem I followed the same steps and realised I was trying to convert the sentence to lowercase at the wrong point. Moved it and it worked!

              Pseudocode has been a great tool for me, compartmentalizing problems really helps. Especially when I need to reflect on what I've already done. I'm confident with this.

                  I find that any time I'm stuck on something someone else has asked the exact questin in a vary similar context, googling is great!

                  I think my reflections are okay, I need to reflect more often and probably return to problems post-reflection to solidify my understanding.

              It's hard to land on a specific time, I haven't really reached the point of feeling like I need to ask for help during this course though I am often reluctant in other aspects of life so I'll get there.
