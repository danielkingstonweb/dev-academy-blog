              I've learned that I tend to leap ahead when I'm feeling confident and get distracted when I'm not. I've actually realised more than before that my emotional intelligence is not so poor. I've balanced a lot during foundations and haven't quite felt overwhelmed doing so. I've learned that it can be hard for me to take things in stride, the idea of a growth mindset is great but it's hard to change peoples mind, especially your own!

              Programming is quite funny in the sense that when you become confident with something it tends to be easier to forget, at least for me. Understand that you make silly errors all the time makes you realise it's not a big deal when someone else does it too. Being able to empathise with the journey is really important and it helps when you're working in teams. It's equally as important to be self-aware and not beat yourself up for something silly. Understanding that you're constantly learning is important because it stops complacency but being in the mindset that you don't know everything helps to forgive those silly mistakes.

              Just how tangible different habits and ways of thinking can be in different areas of life. The things that make you a good friend or family member can also serve to make you better at learning or as an employee. I think just realising that I show others more respect than I do for myself has been interesting and helped me to not be so hard on myself.

              Just trying to implement it all in one fell swoop. Lots of it hasn't been hard but when it comes to habitual change like constant learning reflections, time boxing, or regular meditation it's hard to stick with and easy to make excuses for not doing.

              Being a good person with good communication will help you in many aspects of life but especially in relation to programming. It seems to be that it's rare that you would ever be building a large programme by yourself, especially when you're working as an employee so being able to communicate is arguably more important than your coding ability assuming you know what you're doing.

              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

              I don't think so, I found the neuroplasticity section in relation to a growth mindset to be especially engaging, I remember covering it in the work that lead up to the start of foundations and didn't mind having a refresher a few weeks in. I think having a fair bit of programming experience coming in it was nice to break up the learning.
