              Admittedly going for some low-hanging fruit here. A few years ago my partner at the time and I were living together, she really wanted to get a kitten and I personally didn't want to make that sort of commitment. We discussed it extensively and agreed that if someone we know rescues some kittens and needs to adopt them out we can take one. Less than a week later a good friend of mine rescued two kittens and needed to adopt them out or they would end up at a cat rescue. I really couldn't believe the chances but I decided to stick to my word and we picked him up as soon as we could. I was so adverse to the idea but it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Creed (My cat) has become one of the most important aspects of my life and I plan to bring him with me for the rest of his life.

              Coming from a family of 7 kids I grew up in quite a busy household. I think this has lead me to value relationships above all else in my life, my friend Pearl describes me as a 'Peacemaker'. I hold many friendships that have spanned well over a decade despite me and others moving city and country. This ties directly into a few other important values of mine, Fairness & Judgement. I try to understand everything at play before I make decisions, I try to look from everyone's point of view and predict the possible outcomes of a decision before making it, and most of all I try to give everyone a fair shake. On the back of this is humor, I try to see the funny side of things and often humor is an effective outlet for me to internalise a situation.

              More important than my technical skills are definitely my people skills. I came to Dev Academy not only to sharpen the tools in the code itself but to learn how to be more effective in a collaborative environment. Knowing that people are relying on my is a huge motivator for me and helps me to stick to the task at hand. I think that I learn best when I'm with other people having fun and I think that my ability to have fun with other people is going to really help me (And I hope others) in this journey.

              My limitations definitely lie in time management & consistency. I've spent a long time balancing a lot of different work avenues and although I've built up lots of interesting skills and connections I haven't really built the core base that is required to be truly effective at anything and that is persistence. After I last finished studying I didn't code for probably 4 months, and after that only intermittently. I was more focused on my design and photograpy work and other things too. Deadlines are a great motivator but some of my work requires deadlines that I set for myself and I have a habit of not sticking to those.

              I did some work for a musician last year, doing a poster for an event of theirs. The client had a really strong idea of what they wanted visually. They provided thorough and consistent visual inspiration which is great and not something I often get from musicians! The tension came when they provided me the assets that they wanted to use on the poster, in this case a photo that their friend had taken of them. I tried to work with the image they had provided but it unfortunately wasn't taken with the design of a poster truly in mind, it was busy and over exposed, I couldn't make text stand out clearly and the spacing was wrong. I tried to explain these points to the client but I was more focused on being nice than being clear. The client asked to come over and work through it with me, there was a lot of tension as they didn't have the vocabulary to say what they wanted visually just as I wouldn't in music. We went through all of their ideas even if I knew that it wasn't going to work, eventually they agreed with me and let me design it as I saw fit. Everyone was happy in the end and the event sold out! Although this method worked it was painful and time consuming, this more than doubled the amount of time it took to complete the job. In retrospect if I was to go through this again I would have been much more confident in what I had to say and my reasoning. The reason being is that this experience made me realise times that I had overstepped during collaborative work without realising it. I think establishing a clear and respectful base of communication from the get go is one of the most important things you can do. Respect isn't always about being overly nice.
